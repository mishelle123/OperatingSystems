REMARKS:
********
We chose to add a few more helper methods:

1. doWrite() - this is a start method for a thread, 
   that performs the writing to file process.
2. searchForLowestId() - finds the lowest free id

This library is an output device that support a several threads 
requests.
The idea is to init the device and allow several threads to write to the 
device. 

initdevice() - The creates the working thread: this thread task is to 
write to the file any task given by the user.
It also creates the file "filename", and has to be called first.

write2device() - This methods receives tasks (something to write to the file)
from the user and the new task is entered to a queue of Tasks.
The working thread (ccreated in the init method) writes the task to the 
file. This method return a task id. 

flush2device() - gets a task id and wait until it is written.

closedevice() - close the output file and reset the system so that it is 
possible to call initdevice again. After close device is called no new tasks
are accepted.

wait4close() - Wait for closedevice to finish.
